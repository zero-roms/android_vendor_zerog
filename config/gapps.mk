# ZeroS Google build: the Google set, picked module by module from
# MindTheGapps (vendor/gapps, pinned in the manifest). Its arm64-vendor.mk is
# not inherited: the Android 17 package also installs the Google app, Family
# Link, TalkBack, Google Feedback and Exchange, which ZeroS leaves to the
# Play Store (ROM_PLAN.md, Phase 3A). Anything not listed here is never
# installed. Included from common.mk unless ZEROS_GAPPS=false.
#
# None of these adds a second Contacts, Calendar, Phone, Messages or Clock
# app: the sync adapters feed Google accounts into the existing apps.
